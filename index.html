I was just like you. My parents died. I had to be strong for Serah, so I thought I needed to forget my past. And I
became Lightning. I thought by changing my name, I could change who I was. I was just a kid. Lightning. It flashes
bright, then fades away. It can't protect. It only destroys. Serah tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen. I threatened
her. The only one who believed her was Snow.

Perhaps. Or perhaps, I'll feign the howling of Pulsian wolves and let the fear-addled sheep slaughter themselves first.
Either way, the end is at hand. But what of yourselves? Will you enjoy the festivities beside me? Or perhaps... Greet
the end here, in the land where it all began?

            Hard to believe that I am writing a blog
            about my journey in becoming a web developer.
             My only regret is not doing it sooner as I realized
             this is a better fit for me than becoming an elementary
             school teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite switching career, I am glad to do so now and not
             delaying it any further in the future. I am 26 and my
             goal is to become a proficient web developer and
             obtaning a full time job <em>prior</em> to the age of 30. The bootcamp
             I am planning to attend is <a href="https://learningfuze.com/">
            <strong>Learningfuze</strong></a>.
